| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR event system.              |
| Developed in 2021 by MCUdude                                          |

| In this example, we demonstrate the possibilities of reading out      |
| which event channel we're working with, which generator is used, and  |
| which channel an event user has been connected to.                    |
|                                                                       |
| See Microchip's application note AN2451 for more information.         |
