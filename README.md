# SSTuino II Core

This branch/site contains the Arduino IDE Boards Manager installation support files, making it easy for the Arduino IDE to directly install the file by adding the board manager URL.

The board manager JSON file for the SSTuino II is available [here](package_FourierIndustries-LLP_SSTuino_II_Core_index.json).
